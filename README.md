#Letâ€™s break down React hooks in the simplest way possible :heart_eyes:


A hook is just a special tool in React that helps you make your components smarter and more interactive. ðŸ¤” 

The simplest hook: useState  :happy 

Imagine:
You have a toy (a button in your app). Every time you press it, you want to remember how many times you clicked. This is like a counter.

With useState, React gives you:

A magic box to store a value (like the number of clicks).
A way to read whatâ€™s inside the box.
A way to update the value in the box.
